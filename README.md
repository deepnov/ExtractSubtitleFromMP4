#List-All-File-Names-In-Directory (Completed/Working)
This is a more complex script that creates a list of names for the every files/folder within the directory, this includes sub files/ sub folders, using recursion. Next, the script outputs the list to a text file. Created and Tested on Windows OS.
<br /><br />
Note: <br />
-Indent(s) and an arrow will be given to a sub file or folder. As the sub file or folder increase in depth from the main directory, another indent will be added on.<br /><br />
-Enter in the file directory address to run the script. 
-Created and Tested on Windows OS.
